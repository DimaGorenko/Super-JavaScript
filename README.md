# Super-JavaScript
This project was made by me during my training, not for commercial purposes, but for self-education in order to master the Bootstrap. In this work a minimum of CSS styles, a maximum of Bootstrap classes - an accordion component was used, classes for text, indents, adaptability, etc.
